EBA connects to a [fully synchronized Bitcoin Core](./s1-sync-bitcoin.mdx) 
node and iterates through a set of blocks, 
extracts transaction data, and encodes them as temporal heterogeneous graph. 

For this task, you may take the following steps.

- [Install the program](/gs/installation.md), if you have not installed already.

- Make sure `Bitcoin Core` is running and responding to API calls (see [this page](./s1-sync-bitcoin.mdx)).

- Run `eba`.

    ```shell
    .\aab.eba.exe bitcoin traverse --from 0 --to 1000
    ```

    You may use the following to get all the arguments and their documentation.

    ```shell
    .\aab.eba.exe bitcoin traverse --help
    ```

    <summary>Optimizations and Scaling Potential</summary>

    Traversing Bitcoin blocks can take a considerable amount of time. 
    To accelerate this, 
    EBA heavily leverages multi-threading, 
    and all time-consuming operations are implemented to be non-blocking. 
    It also minimizes the latency between submitting API calls and 
    processing the returned data, 
    which allows data to be handled in parallel threads, 
    so it doesn't wait to encode and persist a block's graph elements before processing the next block.
    However, there is a limit to how many concurrent requests EBA and Bitcoin Core can process optimally. 
    Therefore, despite these optimizations, 
    if both applications are running on the same machine, 
    their performance is ultimately bound by its I/O limits, 
    primarily the random read/write performance of the storage.


    Since EBA processes each block independently, 
    one potential improvement is to deploy the application on a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster 
    (requires dockerizing both EBA and Bitcoin Core).
    In this setup, each instance of EBA service could process a subset of blocks 
    while a load balancer directs its API calls to replicas of the Bitcoin Core services. 
    This horizontal scaling would significantly improve performance; 
    however, because this requires a k8s cluster and cloud or on-premises HPC resources 
    that may not be [widely accessible](/docs/gs/accessibility), 
    the specifics of such a deployment are not currently covered.

## Deduplicate Nodes

This step deduplicates the 
`Tx` (`[0-9]*_nodes_Tx.csv.gz`) and 
`Script` (`[0-9]*_nodes_Script.csv.gz`) 
node files.

<details>

    <summary>Why is deduplication required?</summary>

    For performance reasons, 
    EBA does not attempt to ensure uniqueness in the `Tx` and `Script` files 
    during the initial traversal. 
    Instead, it writes Tx and Script nodes as it encounters them. 
    A `Tx` node is created once when the block containing the transaction is parsed, 
    and again every time that transaction is referenced as a `txin` in subsequent blocks.
    The same applies to `Script` nodes. 
    Consequently, the `Tx` and `Script` nodes files contain a high degree of duplication.

    _Why create a node for every reference instead of only the first appearance?_
    Since EBA allows starting traversal from any arbitrary block, 
    a block within your chosen window may point to a transaction or script 
    created prior to that window. 
    If we only recorded nodes at their point of origin, 
    these references would point to non-existent source nodes, 
    resulting in a broken graph with dangling edges.

    We experimented with using an intermediate database 
    to track uniqueness during traversal 
    (only writing a node if it hadn't been defined yet), 
    but this significantly throttled performance and 
    introduced the overhead of managing a database instance. 

    Crucially, the instance of the node created where the transaction 
    originated contains detailed information, 
    whereas references in subsequent blocks contain minimal information. 
    This means some duplicate entries are rich in data while others 
    are missing feature values. 
    Therefore, we must deduplicate the files by _merging_ duplicates 
    into a single node that retains values for all features.

    This step is critical for the Neo4j import process. 
    While the Neo4j admin tool offers a `--skip-duplicate-nodes` flag, 
    relying on it is discouraged because it only tolerates 
    a limited number of duplicates, 
    and increasing that limit incurs significant performance penalties. 
    Furthermore, Neo4j does not support the merging of data described above; 
    it would simply discard subsequent entries.

</details>


1.  `cd` to the directory where the data is persisted.

2.  Combine the files:

    ```shell
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "[0-9]*_nodes_Tx.csv.gz" -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pigz -dc \
        > combined_nodes_Tx.csv 2> combine_errors_Tx.log
    ```

    ```shell
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "[0-9]*_nodes_Script.csv.gz" -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pigz -dc \
        > combined_nodes_Script.csv 2> combine_errors_Script.log
    ```

    Note that there may be many batches; 
    hence, Methods that expand wildcards into filenames can be limiting 
    because they may exceed the operating system's maximum command-line argument size, 
    potentially causing some batches to be silently omitted. 
    This issue may only become apparent during import into Neo4j, 
    when edges reference nodes from omitted batches, 
    causing the Neo4j import process to fail.
    Therefore, the methods above use `find` instead of wildcard expansion.

3.  Sort the files. 
    Note: Since these files can be very large, 
    the command below is configured to use temporary on-disk files. 
    Ensure you have sufficient disk space (at least as much as the `combined_*` files) 
    and are running on performant media (e.g., SSD with NVMe interface). 
    Adjust the `--buffer-size` according to the available memory on your machine.


    ```shell
    LC_ALL=C sort --buffer-size=32G --parallel=16 --temporary-directory=. -t$'\t' -k1,1 combined_nodes_Tx.csv > sorted_nodes_Tx.csv
    ```

    ```shell
    LC_ALL=C sort --buffer-size=32G --parallel=16 --temporary-directory=. -t$'\t' -k1,1 combined_nodes_Script.csv > sorted_nodes_Script.csv
    ```

4.  Run the following command to deduplicate the files:

    ```shell
    .\aab.eba.exe bitcoin dedup --sorted-script-nodes-file sorted_nodes_Script.csv --sorted-tx-nodes-file sorted_nodes_Tx.csv
    ```

5.  Once deduplication is complete, 
    several large intermediate files are no longer needed for subsequent steps. 
    To keep your working directory organized, 
    the following command moves these files into a separate `original/` directory. 
    You can safely delete them to free up disk space or retain them for debugging purposes.


    ```shell
    mkdir -p original

    find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( \
        -name "[0-9]*_nodes_Script.csv.gz" -o \
        -name "[0-9]*_nodes_Tx.csv.gz" -o \
        -name "combined_nodes_Script.csv" -o \
        -name "combined_nodes_Tx.csv" \
    \) -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t original/ 2>/dev/null
    ```


## Post-Traverse


```shell
.\aab.eba.exe bitcoin post-traverse --batches-filename batches.json
```

For each `*_nodes_Block` and `*_edges_Tx_Credits_Script` file, 
the above command creates a new file that contains the updated information. 
To ensure the downstream steps of the pipeline correctly refer to the files 
containing the updated information, we can run the following script, 
which creates a backup folder named `original` and moves the unmodified data files into it. 
It then takes the newly updated files and removes the extra text from their filenames. 


```shell
mkdir -p original

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name "[0-9]*_nodes_Block.csv.gz" -o -name "[0-9]*_edges_Tx_Credits_Script.csv.gz" \) -print0 \
    | xargs -0 -I {} mv {} original/ 2>/dev/null

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "[0-9]*_edges_Tx_Credits_Script_with_txo_spent_height_set.csv.gz" -print0 \
    | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do
        mv "$f" "${f/_with_txo_spent_height_set/}"
    done

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "[0-9]*_nodes_Block_supply_updated.csv.gz" -print0 \
    | while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do
        mv "$f" "${f/_supply_updated/}"
    done
```
